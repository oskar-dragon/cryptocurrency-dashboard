Bitcoin Cements Itself As A Risk-On Asset During The Year 2021 As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, BTC has behaved like a risk-on asset this year as the crypto&#8217;s price has seemed to follow VIX. &#8220;VIX&#8221; is the ticker symbol for the Chicago Board Options Exchange&#8217;s Volatility Index. This index tells us about the stock market&#8217;s expectations of the volatility based on S&#38;P 500 index options. While the official name is the CBOE volatility index, the name &#8220;VIX&#8221; has caught on as the most popular way to refer to it. The VIX index is a real-time indicator that measures the expected volatility in the market for the coming thirty days. The index is also often referred to as the &#8220;fear gauge.&#8221; When the value of this metric is high, it means a greater volatility in the stock market may follow in the near future. On the other hand, low values of the index would suggest a period of low volatility might be there soon.

The gaming sector is already pioneering the Metaverse era with significant success, and combining it with the advantages of Blockchain technology. Games like Axie Infinity and Sandbox turn in-game assets into Blockchain-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which hold real economic value and can be traded and/or held for long-term appreciation. The use of NFTs in gaming metaverses has resulted in an unprecedented boom in player spending and NFT values: Axie Infinity is generating $2.7 billion in annualized revenues, mostly from NFT character sales, with an in-game currency having a market value of over $9 billion. Sandbox, a virtual world development game, saw its sales of NFT land plots surge by over 1,600% in 2021 with sales of over $3 million per day.

For those who have been invested in the digital asset for a couple of years, they have obviously been making the most profit given the recent rallies in the market. However, there is still a lot of BTC that remains in the possession of what is a small number of bitcoin users and that has led to some concerns regarding the distribution of the digital asset. Majority Of BTC Held In 0.01% Of Wallets It was reported a little over a week ago by the Wall Street Journal that only 0.01% of bitcoin holders held the majority of the asset’s supply. It revealed that about 5 million BTC were held in these wallets, leading to an even larger concentration in the distribution of the digital asset when compared to cash. Estimating the 1% of wealthy individuals in the U.S. controlled about 33% of the dollar supply. Related Reading &#124; Bitcoin Should Not Be Measured In Dollar Terms, Says Pompliano This has sparked debate about if bitcoin is really the equalizer that it is purported to be.
